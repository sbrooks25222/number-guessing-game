🎮 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 10. The program provides feedback (higher/lower), tracks attempts, handles invalid input, and limits guessing attempts. The game also includes a play-again option to restart without closing the program.

🧠 How the Game Works
	1.	The computer picks a random number between 1 and 10.
	2.	The player enters their guess.
	3.	The program tells the player if the guess is too high or too low.
	4.	The game continues until:
	•	The player guesses correctly, or
	•	The maximum number of attempts is reached.
	5.	After the game, the player can choose to play again.

🔧 Requirements
	•	Python 3.x installed

📌 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
	•	Add difficulty levels (e.g., 1–50 or 1–100)
	•	Add scoring system
	•	Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame
	•	Add sound effects or animations
